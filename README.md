# Capstone Project (Coursera) - Little Lemon Restaurant Booking Website

## Project Description
This project was an assignment in Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course.

The website's primary focus was to demonstrate the implementation of a booking application within the context of the Little Lemon Website. 

Notice: the only fully operational feature is the "Reserve a Table" function. The project primarily emphasizes its design and serves as a practical example of React and API integration.
